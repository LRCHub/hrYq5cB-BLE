I was only doing my job for the Company
With a gun in my pocket and no identity
I fell in love with you but we're not free. (C):
Tokyo A go-go, Tokyo A go-go
The dancing spies with evil eyes that walk the night
Tokyo A go-go, Tokyo A go-go
In colored scenes the dancing queens with laser beams.
You were just another boy only seventeen
Well designed for giving pleasure
Just a love machine
Now we've got to run away
We're turning green. (C)
